This document tells how to install and run the software.

Github Repository: "https://github.com/Michael-Ward-Keyin/Advanced_Programming_Sprint_Solo"

Ensuring Java is downloaded on your system is key as the system cannot run without java.
If you do not have java installed make sure you install it before trying to run the program.

Now you will want to clone the github repository from the link above.

Once this is done you will want to compile the code using the javac command

Once you have done this you can run the code by running the command "java Main" which calls the main program to run the system.
